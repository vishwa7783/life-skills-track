# Review Questions

## Question 1
The points that were new to me are:

- The emphasis on using tools like Trello, Jira, or written documentation for gathering and sharing requirements, even within a team that may not use such tools.
- The suggestion to keep video turned on during meetings for improved communication and team rapport.
- The specific recommendations for communication tools like Slack, Whatsapp, and the advice to consolidate multiple questions into a single message.

## Question 2
The area I think I need to improve on is:

**Deep Work and Attention Management:** While I am aware of the concept of deep work, I need to implement better strategies to preserve my attention during work hours. I plan to adopt the recommended practices, such as keeping the phone on silent, removing non-work-related notifications, and potentially using time-tracking apps like Boosted to enhance productivity.

Overall, the key idea is to create a more focused work environment and eliminate distractions to ensure higher levels of productivity.
