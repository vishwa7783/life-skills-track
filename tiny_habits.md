# Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

## Question 1: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most intriguing concept in this video was the idea of starting with "Tiny Habits." BJ Fogg suggests that beginning with small behaviors lasting 30 seconds or less is the key to establishing lasting habits. By commencing with tiny habits, building momentum becomes more achievable, allowing gradual complexity enhancement over time.

## Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?

B = MAP is a formula proposed by BJ Fogg to facilitate habit formation. Here, B represents Behavior, M is for Motivation, A stands for Ability, and P signifies Prompt. Fogg explains that a behavior occurs when Motivation, Ability, and Prompt intersect. To establish a new habit, one must create a Prompt closely associated with an existing behavior, increase Motivation through positive reinforcement, and ensure the new behavior is as easy as possible to perform.

## Question 3: Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

Celebrating or "Shining" after successfully completing a habit is crucial because it reinforces the behavior, making it more likely to become a habit. According to Fogg, whatever you celebrate becomes a habit. By creating a positive association with the behavior through celebration, the likelihood of repeating it in the future is increased.

## Question 4: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most captivating idea in this video was the concept of "aggregating marginal gains." The notion suggests that making small improvements in various areas can lead to significant gains over time. Rather than attempting a massive change all at once, the focus is on making small daily improvements that accumulate over time.

## Question 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The book "Atomic Habits" emphasizes the importance of Identity in creating new habits. According to James Clear, habits are not just about what you do but who you are. To establish new habits, one must first adopt a new identity. By changing the way you see yourself, you can effectively change your behavior.

## Question 6: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

The book suggests that to make a habit easier to do, one should focus on reducing the friction associated with the behavior. Friction refers to any obstacles or barriers that make it more difficult to perform the behavior. By minimizing friction, the behavior becomes more attractive and easier to perform.

## Question 7: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

The book advises that to make a habit harder to do, one should focus on increasing the friction associated with the behavior. This involves introducing obstacles or barriers to make the behavior less attractive and more difficult to perform.

## Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

I would like to do more of meditating every day. To make this habit more obvious, I can set a reminder on my phone to meditate every morning. Making the habit more attractive involves reminding myself of the benefits of meditation, such as reduced stress and increased focus. Starting with just a few minutes of meditation each day can make the habit easier, and I can gradually increase the time over time. Keeping a journal of my progress and celebrating each day that I meditate will make the response more satisfying.

## Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

I would like to spend less time on social media. To make the cue invisible, I can remove social media apps from my phone or use a website blocker to prevent access. Making the process unattractive involves reminding myself of the negative consequences, such as decreased productivity and increased anxiety. Increasing friction, for instance, by setting a timer for a specific amount of time and limiting social media use to that duration, will make the response unsatisfying.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, both BJ Fogg's "Tiny Habits" and the insights from "Atomic Habits" emphasize the power of starting small and building positive associations with behavior. By understanding the factors influencing habits, such as Motivation, Ability, and Prompt, individuals can craft effective strategies for habit formation. The concept of "aggregating marginal gains" underscores the significance of incremental progress over time. Ultimately, adopting a mindful approach to habit creation can lead to lasting and positive lifestyle changes.
